PASSWORD = admin

This is a project that will encrypt the passwd.json file (already has test passwords in) so it cannot be viewed from outside the programme.

There are 3 options:

1: You can add a password and the corresponding name of the website/applicaion that the password if from which will be appended to the .json file.

2: You can show the passwords from the .json file and they will be displayed on screen to be retrieved.

3: Quit. This is an important part of the scipt as this will then encrypt the .json file before closing the programme. CTRL+C will cause the .json
to not be encrypted.
