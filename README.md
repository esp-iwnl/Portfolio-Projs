# Hello, I'm Lewis Tennent

## Brief Introdcution
I am currently deep diving into the CISCO network essentials course. When I'm not in completing and revising modules, you'll find me honing my Python skills, either coding up fresh projects or revisiting old ones to add new features. My tech journey has been a lifelong adventure—I've been immersed in the industry since I was young.
What really gets me going? Cybersecurity. I'm absolutely fascinated by it. I spend a good chunk of my time exploring ethical hacking, using tools like Kali Linux to expand my knowledge and skills. Some of my projects reflect this passion, whether it's crafting a MAC changer, developing a network scanner, or tinkering with an ARP spoofer, I'm always eager to push the boundaries and explore new avenues in cybersecurity.

## Objectives
My objective is clear: i want to carve out a career in the cybersecurity industry, where I can leverage my passion for pentesting, networks, forensics and developing Python scripts to bolster digital defenses. I aspire to continuously expand my knowledge and skills, taking full advantage of all that your college has to offer—be it through coursework, hands-on experiences, or networking opportunities. Ultimately, I'm driven to make meaningful contributions to the field of cybersecurity while continuously pushing the boundaries of the industry and my own aspirations.

## Skills
My current skills include:
- A good understanding of the Kali OS and its terminal.
- Great foundations of the python language.
- Problem solving.
- Attention to detail as that is paramount within the cyber security field.
- Solid grasp of renound ethical hacking tools. To name a few:
. Nmap         . Metasploit-Framework
. Burpsuite    . Wireshark

## CISCO Network Essentials
This course has been fantastic for me and has been a game changer in how I understand networks and how systems communicate. Through the courses hands-on nature through using applications such as packet tracer I have been able to build, sustain and administrate networks. I have also delved into IP and MAC addresses, how they work, why they are important and the handling of them. I have also learnt more about CISCO devices themselves such as switches, routers and the CISCO IOS.

## Hobbies
Due to my passion for cyber secuirty and tech, these career aspirations carry over into my personal life. In my free time I enjoy coding new projects which gives me a chance to bring out my creative side and bring
my ideas to life through programming. Addintionaly I enjoy challenging myself through HackTheBox labs by using my problem solving skills and thirst for achieving coupled with my knowledge in ethical hacking.

I also enjoy not only computer software, but hardware also. I have personaly built 2 PC's (1 being very recent and is my current system). I like to stay up-to-date with new hardware specs from Nvidia and Intel primarily. Building my new system allowed me to start thinking of ways to utilize my old laptop as I understand E-Waste is a growing problem. Therfore I installed Ubuntu Server as it's OS and I now use it as a SSH/FTP server that allows me to backup files and utilize it as an external storage device, alongside being able to run a 24/7 server for me and my friends to play games together such as Minecraft. I utilized my command line knowledge and port forwarding skills to achieve this.

However, when looking for a mental challenge outside of the difital landscape, I love playing chess, strategizing, problem solving and outmaneuvering opponents, it is both thrilling and intellectually stimulating.
Not only is my mental strength important to me, but also my physical well being. I enjoy staying fit and healthy through regular excersise and eating well as it is a great opportunity for me to take my eyes off the screen and provide myself with a much needed break, allowing me to reconnect with the world around me.
